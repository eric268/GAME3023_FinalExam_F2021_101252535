Adding a day to a calendar
1. Drag prefab day into scene and add it as a child to an object with calendar script

3. Fill out remaining information like adding weather systems or changing the special event icon

Changing weather system
1. Go to the day script
2. Increase or decrease weather array and add or remove weather system
3. Under weather system array add the percentage from 0.0 - 1.0 of a weather system occurring
*Important* Weather systems currently only change when a night to day event occurs or day to night event occurs*
*Currently if a day has multiple weather systems they all have an equal chance of being selected*

Changing Time

2. Change time scale from 0 - whatever value

Creating new season

Future Development
 - Very easy to make new day specific events. Simply create a script that will alter some of the season or day characteristics and add it to 
   the day you wish to alter. They can all be accessed via the dayscript.cs
